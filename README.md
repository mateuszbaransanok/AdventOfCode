## Introduction

This repository houses my solutions for Advent of Code challenges. 
Each day's challenge is implemented in a separate directory, and the solutions are organized in a clear and understandable manner.

## Structure

The structure of this repository for each year is as follows:

- `01/`: Contains the solution for Day 1.
  - `input.txt`: Input file for the Day 1 challenge.
  - `solution.py`: Python script containing the solution for Day 1.

- `02/`: Contains the solution for Day 2.
  - `input.txt`: Input file for the Day 2 challenge.
  - `solution.py`: Python script containing the solution for Day 2.

...

Repeat the above structure for each day of the Advent of Code challenge.
